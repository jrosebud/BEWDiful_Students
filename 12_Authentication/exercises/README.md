#Ritly

##Lab Time
####Time: 50 min

We are going to add authentication to Ritly using Devise.

Here is the functionality we need to add this lesson.

* Users must be logged in to Ritly in order to add links.
*	Visitors to Ritly can go to ```localhost:3000/links``` and the application will show them all of the links
*	Visitors to Ritly can go to ```localhost:3000/links/1/show``` and preview the matching URL link from the database.

Note: A visitor is anyone who comes to your site, they are not logged in users. A logged in user is also a visitor.
