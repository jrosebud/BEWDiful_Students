###New  Feature

We want to track which user posted a specific story.
````Story.find_by_user_id()````

The `Story` model does not have a `user_id` attribute..... yet.

---


##Associations

Users need to be __associated__ to a Story.
Stories need to be __associated__ to a User.

---


##Associations
###Definition

Model associations are how models interact with each other.

Adding associations will help us know which user posted which story.

With associations its best to step away from the code and understand conceptually what is happening.

###Rails Active Record Associations

```
belongs_to
has_many
has_many :through
has_one
has_one :through
has_and_belongs_to_many
```

We will cover the first three.

##Associations

User has_many Tweets

Tweet `belongs_to` User

â€¦ a foreign key is a column or a combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables. - __Wikipedia__
