##Quick Fire: 20 min

####Task Instructions

* (option) Make a folder to store all of your Rails applications in (Mine is ~/Sites)
*	Create a new application called movie_app (if you created that directory above, make it in there)
*	Generate a Movies controller with an index action. (Perhaps make another rails app with some scaffolding to help you?)
*	Set your root route to the movies index page.
*	the view file, index.html.erb, welcomes users to the movie app. (Welcome to RetFlix! See our collection of movies below).


##Movie App

Our client RetFlix wants BEWDiful students to develop an app for them.

They want an application that allows visitors to:

* View all movies in the database.
* Add a new movie to the database.
* Edit a movie in the database.
* And search for a specific movie.

We will build a Rails app for RetFlix during lesson 9 & 10. Each lesson we will add more functionality to the app.

Paring is Sharing, and happy coding :)


##(Lab Time) Movie Model: 60 min

####Task Instructions

*	Use the [seeds](seeds.rb) file to populate your database with movies.
*	Update your movie's index.html.erb so that it list all movies in the database. (Google is your friend).
	*	Rails console is also your friend. Use it to explore active record methods that help you interact with the database.
